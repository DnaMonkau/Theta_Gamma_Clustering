# Theta_Gamma_Clustering
This repository contains three ways to analyse theta-gamma coupling.

First, I reccomend an attempt on the cross frequency coupling analysis to get a rough idea of what to expect from the data.

After which please refer to Lu Zang's github repository (https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/IndividualThetaCluster) for the necessary orginal filed to generate the FPP and community cluster amount, a duplicate file of the exact changes I made has been added in this repository.

Lastly, run  the k-means and/or HMM to get the gamma clusters and significance

Note: Merged.ipynb needs to be changed according to the file paths on your device
